This is here so that the logs directory exists (since we don't want to commit logs, 
but the code breaks if the dir doesn't exist)

Ideally, we should change this in logger.go, so that it creates the directory if
it doesn't already exist. But in the interest of time, I'm putting this here so
that we can add the folder to source control, but just ignore any logs in it.
